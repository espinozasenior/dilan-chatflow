# Use this Blueprint to deploy n8n on Render as a web
# service that uses a Postgres database to store
# workflow data.

# This Blueprint uses free instance types (specified by
# `plan`) for both the web service and the database. You
# can upgrade to paid instance types at any time to
# increase resources.
